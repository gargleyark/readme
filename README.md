## Why

This readme should allow you to understand who I am.

Main goals of this document:

- Helping you get to know what I'm about!
- Helping me stay on track with my values and goals

Mike is not available via NPM or Yarn. He may experience compatability issues with Windows.

## My key values

- Mentoring & Coaching - It's important for me to be able to help those around me grow, and coaching and mentoring those around me is key to this. I'm interested in you and what you want from your career - and I want to help you continue to grow to the best of your potential.
- Joint ownership - Projects are built by teams, not individuals. Success comes when we work together, not apart. Failures are also shared and I do not believe in a blame culture - Failure should be celebrated and learned from.
- Constant iteration and improvement - Whether this is related to refactoring code, trialing new ways of working, or mentoring and training to prevent knowledge becoming siloed. Iterating on what has gone before and making sure the next step in a project is always an improvement is an important focus of mine.
- Radical candor - Care for the people around you; be direct towards anything that clearly isn't ok and help them be the best that they can be.
- Law of two feet - I don't expect you to waste your valuable time; if a meeting is dragging on or going off topic then voice it, and if you have something more important to do then go and do it.

## Working hours:
I normally kick off my day (either over breakfast at home or while commuting in) by checking emails/catching up on messages before standup at 9am. From then I will usually be available until at least 5:30pm. The best way to reach me while I'm at work is via Slack - but if I'm in the office then come and find me!

For important questions or emergencies I'm available by Slack at any reasonable hour of the day or night (but I do NOT expect the same from my team). If you need my immediate attention then please give me a call.

If I'm on holiday then it will be clearly marked in my calendar and I'll have a Slack status set. I am often (intentionally) on holiday with very limited internet connectivity. 

# What do I do?

## I/O and Communication

- I try my best to always be available to help, if you want to talk about something but think that I'm busy then ping me a slack\* message.
- If something is urgent then there's nothing quicker than tapping me on the shoulder even if I'm in the middle of something else, I won't mind!
- If you need to put something in my calendar then just do it, I keep it up to date and my holiday will be clearly marked.
- Beware overpromises. Mike will often attempt to resolve too many requests, which can lead to delays in responses.
- Some\*\* communication may occur in [indecipherable jeff emojis](http://cultofjeffgoldblum.com/). Humour me.

## Features
- Javascript/Typescript
- Data driven over opinion driven
- Constant, fair feedback. Regular and objective coaching
- Focus on high quality user experience
- TDD
- Pairing/Mobbing
- Slightly too pointy beard

## Quick Start

The quickest way to get started with Mike is to utilize the executable [`conversation`] method to generate behaviour as shown below:

```bash
hi mike
 > hi there
```

Check the status of Mike:

```bash
how are you?
 > I am well. and yourself?
```

```bash
i am also well
 > that is good
```

Start the process:

```bash
want to grab a coffee?
 > obviously
```

After 5pm coffee must be replaced by beer.

_Please make sure language version is set to EN or [JEFF](http://cultofjeffgoldblum.com/). Mike can attempt to use the ES language version, but communication will be vastly reduced._

### Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability with Mike, please see [Security Policies and Procedures](https://www.hart.gov.uk/sites/default/files/4_The_Council/Policies_and_published_documents/Corporate_policies/Office%20Security%20Policy%20and%20Procedure.pdf).

## Protocols

Mike will generally broadcast using the PUN protocol. If you want him to be quiet you can attempt SSH.

```bash
mike be quiet
 > huh?
shh
 > oh, ok
```

## Tests

To test the status of mike, first install the dependencies, then run `mike, how are you?`:

```bash
hi mike
mike, how are you?
 > I am fine
```
