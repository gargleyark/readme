## Why

This readme should allow you to understand what Mike is.

Main goals of this document:

- Helping you understand Mike's confusing obsession with :jeff: emojis
- Helping Mike stay on track with his values and goals

Mike is not available via NPM or Yarn. He may experience compatability issues with Windows.

## Mike's key values

- Listen - I want to understand what is going on around me so that I can see the big picture.
- Joint ownership - projects are built by teams, not individuals. Success comes when we work together, not apart.
- Constant iteration and improvement - Whether this is related to refactoring code, trialing new ways of working, or mentoring and training to prevent knowledge becoming siloed. Iterating on what has gone before and making sure the next step in a project is always an improvement is an important focus of mine.
- Radical candor - care for the people around you; be direct towards anything that clearly isn't ok and help them be the best that they can be.
- Law of two feet - I don't expect you to waste your valuable time; if a meeting is dragging on or going off topic then voice it, and if you have something more important to do then go and do it.

## What do I do?

## I/O and Communication

- I try my best to always be available to help, if you want to talk about something but think that I'm busy then ping me a slack message.
- If something is urgent then there's nothing quicker than tapping me on Mike's shoulder even if I'm in the middle of something else, I won't mind!
- If you need to put something in my calendar then just do it, I keep it up to date and my holiday will be clearly marked.
- Some\* communication may occur in indecipherable jeff emojis. Humour me.

## Quick Start

The quickest way to get started with Mike is to utilize the executable [`converse(true)`] method to generate behaviour as shown below:

```bash
hi mike
 > hi there
```

Check the status of Mike:

```bash
how are you?
 > I am well. and yourself?
```

```bash
i am also well
 > that is good
```

Start the process:

```bash
want to grab a coffee?
 > obviously
```

_Please make sure language version is set to EN or JEFF. Mike can attempt to use the ES language version, but communication will be vastly reduced._

### Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability with Mike, please see [Security Policies and Procedures](https://www.hart.gov.uk/sites/default/files/4_The_Council/Policies_and_published_documents/Corporate_policies/Office%20Security%20Policy%20and%20Procedure.pdf).

## Protocols

Mike will generally broadcast using the PUN protocol. If you want him to be quiet you can attempt SSH.

```bash
mike be quiet
 > huh?
shh
 > oh, ok
```

## Jeff Protocol (<img src="http://www.cultofjeffgoldblum.com/index_files/badlydrawnjeff width="24" height="24" /> <img src="http://www.cultofjeffgoldblum.com/index_files/jeff width="24" height="24" /> <img src="http://www.cultofjeffgoldblum.com/index_files/jeff width="24" height="24" /> <img src="http://www.cultofjeffgoldblum.com/index_files/jeffjobs width="24" height="24" /> <img src="http://www.cultofjeffgoldblum.com/index_files/jeff width="24" height="24" /> <img src="http://www.cultofjeffgoldblum.com/index_files/badlydrawnjeff width="24" height="24" /> <img src="http://www.cultofjeffgoldblum.com/index_files/jeffjobs width="24" height="24" />)

This is a protocol used for communicating in Jeff emojis. This is the default protocol for Mike and cannot be reconfigured.
